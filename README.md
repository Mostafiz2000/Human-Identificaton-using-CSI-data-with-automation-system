# Human-Identificaton-using-CSI-data-with-automation-system
This Project presents an innovative IoT system for indoor human identifica-
tion. The system utilizes advanced techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze gait character-
istics. It collects Channel State Information (CSI) from two cost-effective ESP32
Devices, aiming to simplify existing approaches while enhancing accuracy. The
developed method achieves impressive identification rates, with an average ac-
curacy of 82% for ten individuals. By combining deep learning models with
a server back-end system and controlled from mobile application, the system enables automated feature extraction by
lessing the pre-processing steps, reducing the need for time-consuming human
pre-processing. One significant advantage of this research system is the elimina-
tion of laborious manual feature extraction, which improves the overall efficiency
and effectiveness of the pedestrian recognition process. This breakthrough tech-
nology holds great potential for non-contact pedestrian identification, offering
a streamlined and highly accurate method. The automated system has wide-
ranging applications in fields such as surveillance, access control, and smart cit-
ies. Its development and refinement could lead to significant improvements in
security and convenience
